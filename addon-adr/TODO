Exclamation Necromancer Bugs
I am currently experiencing bugs with Necromancer abilities. For example I have Blockade of Elements on slot 1 of back bar and Stalking Blastbones on slot 1 of 
front bar, and when I use Blockade of Elements then bar swap, it shows my Blockade of Elements above slot 1 while on my front bar, but as soon as I use Stalking 
Blastbones, Stalking Blastbones overrides Elemental Blockade and takes its place, even while still on the front bar. I will attach an image when I get home to clarify.

Overflowing Altar is not tracking reliably with this addon, specifically in vBRP. It's making it really hard to know whether it's down or not without scanning constantly for the altar. I had to setup a tracker in S'rendarr because Action Duration Reminder wasn't always recognizing it.

I would even test it b/t rounds in the hallway and the timer would appear. Then thinking it was working, I'd proceed into the arena, where my altar would not create a timer on the ability bar.

Hi there,

your changelog says:
Code:
Optimized for stackable abilities i.e. Flame Skull.
If I cast any non-stackable ability more than once after another, like applying with a restoration staff the shield on several players, the icon sometimes shows a small 2 in the top right corner.
But these abilities are not able to stack afaik. They just overwrite if they were applied on the same target.
This happens on my Necromancer (healer) e.g.

This also happens for other non-stackable attacks like necromancer's "Death Scythe" (https://elderscrollsonline.wiki.fext...m/Death+Scythe) or it's magicka morph "Hungry Scythe" (https://elderscrollsonline.wiki.fext.../Hungry+Scythe)

Is this only a visual bug? Somehow it distracts me as I always think there is some stack on someone and then I recognize the skill cannot stack at all.

I think this is the problem with overflowing altar:

"v3.1.10
- Added rules to detect stage info like Rearming Trap.
- Optimized effect matching by comparing the action which is matched by other effect at the same time. i.e. Minor Force trigged several seconds after Rearming Trap action is now recognized.

v3.1.9
- Added a rule to detect multi-staged abilities like Haunting Curse and show a small 1/2 and 2/2."

Because if you use it where there is no enemies the countdown starts. If you use it near enough to apply the debuff, even to one single enemy, and even not in combat, it detects the debuff and the countdown on the altar goes to 0.0 instantly.

Timers
I've been experiencing a bug where if you recast a placed dot (blockade of elements, 
twisting path, etc) before it reaches 0, then the timers for those dots will show 0s whenever you are holding block
